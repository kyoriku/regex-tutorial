## Description
In today's digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber threats are rampant, ensuring the security of user accounts is paramount. One crucial aspect of data security is enforcing robust password policies that prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, serve as powerful tools for validating password strength by defining specific patterns that passwords must adhere to.

This Regex Tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing regular expressions (regex) for validating password strength. This tutorial is designed for developers and individuals interested in cybersecurity who want to enhance their understanding of password validation mechanisms using regex patterns.

## Installation
To access and use the Regex Tutorial:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Password-Validation-Regex.md file to begin reading the tutorial content.
3. Explore the script.js to see practical implementations of the regex pattern for password validation using JavaScript.

## Usage
The Regex Tutorial provides detailed explanations and examples of the following regex components:

1. Anchors: Explanation of special characters that assert positions in the string, such as ^ (caret) and $ (dollar sign).
2. Positive Lookaheads: Introduction to zero-width assertions in regex that check if a certain pattern is followed by another pattern, without consuming any characters in the string.
3. Bracket Expressions (Character Classes): Exploration of character classes or character sets, which allow specifying a set of characters from which the regex engine can match a single character at a given position in the string.
4. Quantifiers: Discussion on meta-characters in regex that specify the number of instances of the preceding element allowed in a match, controlling the repetition of characters, groups, or character classes in the regex pattern.

Readers can follow the tutorial to gain a comprehensive understanding of these components and how they contribute to enforcing strong password validation.
